This package was developed as part of a LAB assignment at Linkoping Universtiy. The package fits a Linear Regression Model using Ordinary Least Squares and QR decompostion method. So far, only former gives t-values and p-values while the latter gives estimates of beta and residuals and variances of the beta estimates. The functions:
- linreg: Linear Regression function by OLS
- linreg_QR: Linear Regression function by QR decomposition.
